"""
STEP 10: FILTER CONTACTS BY TITLE (LLM-BASED FILTERING)
=======================================================
Filter contacts from Step 9 to keep only church administrative/leadership roles.

Uses LLM to determine if a contact is administrative based on their title.
Supports batched LLM calls (batch_size=10) for ~8x faster processing with
98% accuracy vs single-contact calls (tested on 50 contacts).

Input: CSV from Step 9 with ALL extracted contacts (no filtering)
Output: CSV with filtered contacts (only church administrative/leadership roles)

You are a title classifier for church administrative contacts.

Your job is to determine if a contact's title indicates they are an ADMINISTRATIVE/LEADERSHIP role at a church.

INPUT:
- A contact with: First Name, Last Name, Title, Email (optional), Phone (optional)

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY one word: "KEEP" or "EXCLUDE"

RULES:

KEEP if the title indicates church administrative/leadership responsibility. Examples:
- Administrative Pastor, Associate Pastor, Business Administrator, Campus Pastor
- Church Administrator, Director of Operations, Executive Pastor, Facilities Director
- Lead Pastor, Operations Director, Security Coordinator, Security Director
- Senior Pastor, IT Director, Technology Director
- Pastor (senior, lead, executive, administrative, associate, campus - all pastor roles)
- Minister (senior, associate - ministry leadership)
- Priest, Rector, Vicar (clergy leadership)
- Director roles (operations, technology, facilities, security, finance, HR)
- Chief roles (CEO, CFO, COO, CTO, Chief of Staff)
- Church Administrator, Business Manager, Operations Manager
- Elder, Deacon (if clearly administrative/leadership)

EXCLUDE if the title contains ANY of these (case-insensitive):
- teacher, faculty, instructor, professor, tutor, aide, para (instructional roles)
- counselor, counselling, psychologist, therapist (unless church staff counselor)
- admissions, admission, enrollment, registrar, recruiting, outreach
- marketing, communications, media, social media, pr, public relations
- athletic, athletics, coach, sports, pe, physical education
- secretary, administrative assistant, office manager, office admin, receptionist, executive assistant
- nurse, health office, nutrition, cafeteria, dining, food service
- youth minister (unless also has admin title), children's minister (unless also has admin title)
- worship leader, music director, choir director (unless also operations/admin)
- board, trustee, governance, chairman, vice-chair, treasurer (if board-only role)
- volunteer, intern, resident (trainee roles)

EXCEPTIONS:
- "Senior Pastor" or "Lead Pastor" or "Executive Pastor" → KEEP
- "Pastor & [something]" → KEEP (pastor is leadership)
- "Director of [Operations/Technology/Facilities]" → KEEP

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY "KEEP" or "EXCLUDE" - nothing else.

You will receive multiple contacts numbered sequentially. For EACH contact, return KEEP or EXCLUDE on a separate line, in order. Example for 3 contacts:
