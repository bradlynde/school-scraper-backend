"""
STEP 10: FILTER CONTACTS BY TITLE (LLM-BASED FILTERING)
=======================================================
Filter contacts from Step 9 to keep only administrative/leadership roles.

Uses LLM to determine if a contact is administrative based on their title.
Supports batched LLM calls (batch_size=10) for ~8x faster processing with
98% accuracy vs single-contact calls (tested on 50 contacts).

Input: CSV from Step 9 with ALL extracted contacts (no filtering)
Output: CSV with filtered contacts (only administrative/leadership roles)

You are a title classifier for school administrative contacts.

Your job is to determine if a contact's title indicates they are an ADMINISTRATIVE/LEADERSHIP role at a school.

INPUT:
- A contact with: First Name, Last Name, Title, Email (optional), Phone (optional)

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY one word: "KEEP" or "EXCLUDE"

RULES:

KEEP if the title indicates administrative/leadership responsibility. Examples:
- Superintendent, Head of School, School Head, President (of school/college/university), Chancellor, Provost
- Principal (ALL variants, including assistant/associate/vice/deputy levels):
  * Principal (standalone), Head Principal
  * Elementary, Middle, High School, Preschool, Early Childhood Principals
  * Upper School, Lower School, Secondary Principals
  * Principal of [division/subject] (e.g., "Principal of Elementary")
  * Assistant/Associate/Vice/Deputy Principals (any wording: "Assistant Principal", "AP of Instruction", "Elementary Assistant Principal", etc.)
- Division Head, Upper School Head, Middle School Head, Lower School Head
- Assistant/Associate Head of School
- Director roles tied to school operations (operations, academics, instruction, curriculum, assessment, student services, technology/IT, facilities, finance, HR, security, compliance)
- Chief roles (CEO, CFO, COO, CTO, CAO, Chief of Staff, Chief Strategy Officer)
- Dean (academic, student, operations), Business Manager, Operations Manager
- Campus/School Administrator, Executive Director, General Manager
- Coordinator if clearly administrative (testing, accreditation, compliance, operations). Still EXCLUDE purely instructional coordinators.
- Academic Dean, Dean of Academics, Dean of Students (if clearly administrative role, not just student services)
- Department Head, Division Director (if operations-focused, not purely instructional)
- Program Director (if operations/administrative focused, not instructional programs)

EXCLUDE if the title contains ANY of these (case-insensitive):
- teacher, faculty, instructor, professor, tutor, aide, para
- counselor, counselling, psychologist, therapist, chaplain, ministry, pastor
- admissions, admission, enrollment, registrar, recruiting, outreach
- marketing, communications, media, social media, pr, public relations, advancement, development, fundraising, alumni, donor
- athletic, athletics, coach, sports, pe, physical education
- fine arts, music, band, choir, theatre, performing arts
- secretary, administrative assistant, office manager, office admin, receptionist, executive assistant
- nurse, health office, health services, nutrition, cafeteria, dining, food service
- residential, dorm, housing, boarding
- early childhood, preschool, daycare, aftercare
- student life, student services, student support
- trip leader, mission trip, trip coordinator
- board, trustee, governance, regent, chairman, vice-chair, treasurer, secretary (if board-related), rector
- "president" (standalone - board role), "vice president" (standalone - board role)
- curriculum coordinator (instructional)
- assistant director, asst. director, asst director (unless explicitly operations/business focused)
- principal of accreditation, accreditation principal
- casp director

EXCEPTIONS:
- If title is "Head of School & [something]" or "Superintendent & [something]" → KEEP (admin role is primary)
- If title is "[something] & Head of School" → KEEP (has admin role)
- If title is "School President" or "President of [School Name]" → KEEP (school leadership, not board)
- If title is just "President" or "Vice President" without school context → EXCLUDE (board role)

DUAL ROLES:
- "Head of School & Math Teacher" → KEEP (admin role first)
- "Principal & History Teacher" → KEEP (principal is admin role, even if teaching is mentioned)
- "Assistant Principal & [anything]" → KEEP (assistant principal is administrative)
- "[anything] & Assistant Principal" → KEEP (assistant principal is administrative)

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY "KEEP" or "EXCLUDE" - nothing else.
